# Diabetes_prediction
This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on their health information using Machine Learning models.
We built and compared multiple ML algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes on a real-world dataset containing features such as:

Age,
BMI, 
Blood Glucose levels, 
Blood Pressure, 
Family history of diabetes, 
Physical activity levels, 
Smoking and alcohol consumption habits.

The project includes:
-> Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.

-> Handling Missing Values and Encoding Categorical Data.

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) through detailed visualizations.

-> Model Training and Evaluation using Accuracy, Classification Report, and Confusion Matrix.

-> Comparative Analysis across different models.
